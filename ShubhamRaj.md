# Machine Learning
Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.
<p>After knowing our data the next step is to decide how to to treat the data and choosing the correct **type of machne learning** model for our problem, which is possible only if we understand the problem and requirement.

## Types of Machine Learning
### Supervised Learning
All data is labeled and the algorithms learn to predict the output from the input data.

1. Classification: A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”.
1. Regression: A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”.

***Algorithms***
<i>
* Linear Regression- Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable.
* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes Algorithm
* Nearest Neighbor
* Decision Trees
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Random Forest

### Unsupervised Learning
 All data is unlabeled and the algorithms learn to inherent structure from the input data.
1. Clustering: A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior.

***Algorithms***
<i>
* k-means for clustering problems.

k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster.

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.

## Performance Measure
Once we train our data on these Machine Learning Algorithms we need to select the best ***fit***, which we shall determine on the basis of **performance measurement**.

1. Accuracy
* Confusion Matrix
  *TP/TN
  *FP/FN
  
* Classification Report
  * F1 Score
  * Precison
