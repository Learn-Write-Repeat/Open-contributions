## Machine Learning:    
```
Clustering Techniques (k-means, hierachical)    
Dimenstionality Reduction(only theory)    
Regression(Simple, Multiple)    
Logistic Regression   
Naive-Bayes Classifier    
Support Vector Machines   
Decision Trees, Random Forests, AdaBoost    
Evaluation Metrics (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, AOC ROC, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
```
**Note:  Just to be more precise in understanding, started 100 days challenge where the objective is to re-learn all the topics from scratch level.**

## Deep Learning:
```
Convolutional Neural Networks:  learnt in the process of implementing the mini project Hierarchical CNN for Fashion Image Classification.
  - Forward Propagation
  - Backward Propagation
  - Gradient updates (Batch Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent)
  - convolutional layers, max pooling layers
  - activation functions.

Deeplearning.ai Specialization:  learnt all basic things needs to taken care when were implementing an neural network.
  - Basics about neurons
  - Binary Classification using Logistic Regression
  - Cost Function, Gradient Descent, Forward Propagation, Backward Propagation, Gradients updates.
  - Vectorization
  - Broadcasting
  - Activation Functions (linear, nonlinear - ReLU, LeakyReLU, Tanh, Sigmoid)
  - Effect of random initialisations of weights and intialising weights with zeros
  - Bias-Variance tradeoff
  - Forbenius Norm
  - Regularization, Dropout Regularization
  - Data Augmentation
  - Difference between Normalied Data and Actual(Non-Normalised) Data
  - Usecases of Batch Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent
  - Gradient Descent, Momentum, RMS Propagation
  - Adam optimization (Gradient Descent + Momentum + RMS Propagation)
  - learning rate decay
  - Tuning of hyperparameters
  
 kaggle:  Inorder to test the understanding, anlysing the kaggle questions.
 - task: Analysed the MNIST dataset.
 
```

## Computer Vision:
```
 - task:  Identifying the human eye, face using the hassercodes, inputing an image and video. 
 - task:  Detecting the facial key points to analyse the individual emotion, inputing an image.
 - task:  Identifying the person from an inputing image after training the model.
 - task:  Mask, no-Mask prediction using live feed from camera(still working) 
```
**Note: Still figuring out mini project(basics) implementations**
