# This what I have learned From Module 2



## On module 2 I have learned these bascis


- 1. Supervised Learning
- 2. Unsupervised Learning
- 3. Regression Problem
- 4. Classification Problem
- 5. Performance Measure
- 6. Linear Regression


# And learned avout some algorithms foundation like random forest, liear rigression, KNN, K-means, etc



## On Supervised Learning I got the info from this module


- Expert System.
- Training DataSet.
- Validation DataSet.
- Test DataSet.
- Target Variable.
- Classification.
- Regression.
- Feature.


## On Unsupervised Learning


- Clustering
- Hierarchical clustering


## On Classification Problem


- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines


And also I have learned much more thing about Classification Problem Evaluation Metrics, Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction using Machine Learning, etc.
