# What is Linear Regression? :confused:
=> Regression is form of predictive modelling technique which investigates a relationship between dependent and independent variables. It is of two types Linear and 
Logistic regression. When there is linear relationship between dependent and independent variables i.e when data is modelled using straight line we use linear Regression. 
In Linear regression there is always increasing/decreasing of one variable due to increasing/decreasing of other variable. The realtionship between dependent and independent variables is defined as y = mx + c where m = slope of line, c = intercept of line, x = independent variable and y = independent variable. In particular the purpose of 
linear regression is to predict the value of the dependent variable based upon the the values of one or more independent variables.

# Why Linear Regression is important? :flushed:
=> There are three important uses of linear regression and those are a.Trend forecasting b.forecasting an effect c.determining the strength of predictors.
a.Trend Forecasting: First regression analysis predicts trends and future values. The regression analysis can be used to get point estimates like what will 
be price of Bitcoin in next 3 months?
b.Forecasting an effect: It can be used to forecast effects or impact changes i.e how much effect independent variable has on dependent variable. 
eg. how much additional sale income will I get for each additional 1000 rupee spent on marketing.
c.determining the strength of predictors: It is used to identify strength of the effects that independent variables has on dependent variables. for example 
what is strength of relationship between sales and marketing spending.

# Advantages of Linear Regression over other Regression:
1.Linear regression performs well  when data set is linearly separable. We can use it to find nature of realtionship among other variables.
2.It is easy to implement,interpret and efficient to train.
3.Linear regression is prone to over-fit but it can be easily avoided using dimensionality reduction technique, regularization.
