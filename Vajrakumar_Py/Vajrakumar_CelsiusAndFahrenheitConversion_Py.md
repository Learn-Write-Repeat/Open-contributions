# Relation Between Celsius And Fahrenheit

Celsius and Fahrenheit are two scales used to measure temperature. The temperature in the centigrade scale will be expressed in degrees Celsius. The temperature in the Fahrenheit scale will be expressed in degrees Fahrenheit. The relation between Celsius and Fahrenheit is proportional. Both have a different freezing point of water and both follow the varied unit difference between each scale.


## Celsius to Fahrenheit

The conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit can be mathematically expressed as-

> **F=(95×C)+32** 

Where,

-   F is the temperature in Fahrenheit.
-   C is the temperature on the Centigrade scale.

## Fahrenheit to Celsius

The conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius can be mathematically expressed as-
> **C=59(F−32)** 

Where,

-   F is the temperature in Fahrenheit.
-   C is the temperature on the Centigrade scale.


**Examples:**
| Type| Description | Results     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| **1 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit**| F=(95×1)+32 | 33.8 °F   |
| **1 Fahrenheit to Celsius**| C=59(1−32) | -17.2222 °C     |

The relation between Celsius and Fahrenheit is direct. The Celsius is directly proportional to Fahrenheit. Which implies that –

-   When the temperature in Celsius scale increases, it’s Fahrenheit temperature equivalent temperature will also be high.
-   When the temperature in Celsius scale decreases, it’s Fahrenheit temperature equivalent temperature will also be low.

Both scales have their own  [thermometer]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermometer))  for measurements. Fahrenheit scale is proposed by taking 32 °F as a freezing point of water and 212 °F as a boiling point of water. Whereas in the Celsius scale 0 °C is the freezing point of water and 100 °C is the boiling point of water.
