# Object detection in openCV
- Objects detection refers to the capability of the systems to loacte an object in an image.
- Its applications are face detection, vehicle detection etc.
- To install openCV run this command in the terminal.
- pip install opencv-python

- Haar Cascade is a machine learning-based approach where a lot of positive and negative images are used to train the classifier.
- Haar Cascade classifiers are an effective way for object detection.
- Positive images- Images which contains the image which we want.
- Negative images- Images which we do not want.

- In deep learning-based object detection there are three methods.
- Faster R-CNNs 
- You Only Look Once (YOLO) 
- Single Shot Detectors (SSDs) 

- Object detection and recognition form the most important use case for computer vision, they are used to do powerful things such as

- Labelling scenes
- Robot Navigation
- Self-driving cars
- Body recognition (Microsoft Kinect)
- Disease and cancer detection
- Facial recognition
- Handwriting recognition
- Identifying objects in satellite images

- Object Detection VS Recognition

- Object recognition is the second level of object detection in which computer is able to recognize an object from multiple objects in an image and may be able to identify it.
