# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
## In this file i'm using LinearRegression Method to predict the price of the house 
#### In this i'm using a kaggle's dataset for training , validation and testing the model.
#### I have implemented this code in a simple step-by-step process which i have mentioned on each step of the code.
##### 1.Download and explore the data.
##### 2.Prepare the dataset for training.
##### 3.Train a linear regression model.
##### 4.Make predictions and evaluate the model.
#### At last i have used RMSE(Root mean squared error) for analysing model.
