    "In this module I have learnt about different concept in computer vision like segmentation (learn how to implement marker-based</br>\n",
    " image segmentation using water shed algorithm) ,contours( Mainly it is used in Object Detection) .</br>After that I had practically implemented the first project in this module i.e, Finding an object</br>  and mark itâ€™s extreme points.In that given blog it demonstrates that how to  find extreme points along</br> a contour with OpenCV and Python.After that understanding the concept of shape detection (Finding specific patterns in image)</br> and learnt about the concept of face detection and description and various algorithm that is used for the face detection.</br> </br>Then understanding the haar classifier and use haar classifier algorithm in programming</br> on face and eye detection.\n",
    "Learn about Flask ,WSGI,Jinja2 and how to install flask ,setFlask_App and run it then how to built ML Model using Flask and how it works.Next come to the</br>  second project of the module i.e, Face Detection Using OpenCV - used OpenCv modules and HaasarCodes</br> to identify the face from an camera feed and deploy it using Flask.\n"
