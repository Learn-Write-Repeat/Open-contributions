# PYTHON TUPLES

### Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable

### Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

### A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

### Tuples are written with round brackets.

### Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.

### Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

### When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

### Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.

### To determine how many items a tuple has, use the len() function

### A tuple can contain different data types
