# My understanding of this module
Machine Learning is a sub-part of Artificial Intelligence. By allowing machines to learn a pattern, we can make predictions on the new queries.
There are mainly three types of Machine Learning:-Supervised, Unsupervised learning and Reinforcement learning.
* Unsupervised Learning:- The info collected here has no labels and you're undecided about the outputs. So you model your program such it can understand patterns from the input file and provides the desired answer(output).

* Supervised Learning:- Supervised Learning works under supervision.The dataset that you have collected here is labelled and so you know what input needs to be mapped to what output. This helps you correct your program if there is some mistake.
## Supervised Learning
### Types of Supervised Learning
* Regression
* Classification
#### Regression
Here, we have to predict numerical values as output.
Algorithms:-
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest

Applications:-
* Prediction of housing prices
* Prediction of cab fare
* Prediction of sales of a store
#### Classification
Here, we have to predict categories and classes as output.
Algorithms:-
* Decision Tree
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest

Applications:-
* Spam e-mail detection
* Sentiment analysis
* Classification of cats and dogs

## Unsupervised Learning
Here, the labels are unknown. And the problem os itself is not self-explanatory.

### Clustering
The similar items are grouped together and hence, we make 'clusters'. Those are our the labels that are created.

Applications:-
* Clustering of cancerous and non-cancerous cells
* Market segmentation
* Social network analysis
* Library use- Segmentation of different books based on similar books
* New types of fraud detection
