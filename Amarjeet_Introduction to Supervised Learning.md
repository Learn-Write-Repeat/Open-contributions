# Introduction to supervised learning

Supervised Learning is the process of making an algorithm to learn to map an input to a particular output. This is achieved using the labelled datasets that you have collected.  Supervised Learning algorithms can help make predictions for new unseen data that we obtain later in the future. 

Supervised learning provided with two sets of data(if dataset is smaller), a training set and a validation set
and test set. but provide three sets of data(if dataset is greater) , a training set , a validation set and test set.

The idea is for the model to “learn” from a set of labeled examples in the training set so that it can
identify unlabeled examples in the test set with the highest possible accuracy.

There are many different approaches that attempt to build the best
possible method of classifying examples of the test set by using the data given in
the training set.

In supervised learning, the training set consists of n ordered pairs (x1, y1),
(x2, y2), ...,(xn, yn), where each x1 is some parameters of data,
and y1 is the label for that data .

For example, an x might be a group of five parameters for a patient in a hospital including height, weight, temperature, blood sugar
level, and blood pressure. 
The corresponding yi might be a classification of the patient as “healthy” or “not healthy”.

Supervised learning can be done in two ways:
## 1. Regression  

Regression analysis helps us to understand how the value of the dependent variable is changing corresponding to an independent variable when other independent variables are held fixed. It predicts continuous/real values such as temperature, age, salary, price, etc.

It is a statistical method used in finance, investing, and other disciplines 
that attempts to determine the strength and character of the relationship between 
a series of other variables and one dependent variable.

 ### Types of Regression : 

Linear Regression

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Regression

Decision Tree Regression




## 2.  Classification
Classification is a process of categorizing a given set of data into classes.The process starts with predicting the class of given data points. The classes are often referred to as target, label or categories.

Classification is a type of supervised learning. It specifies the class to which data elements belong to and
 is best used when the output has finite and discrete values. It predicts a class for an input variable as well.

 ### Types of classification :
 
 Random Forest classifier
 
 Decision Trees classifier
 
 support vector machine classifier
 
 Nearest Neighbour classifier
 
### Advantages of Supervised Learning

1. Supervised learning is a simple process for to understand.
2. Easily identifies trends and patterns
3. Supervised machine learning is to predict a target numerical value from some given data and labels.
4. No human intervention needed (automation)

Machine Learning is a technique of training machines to perform the activities a human brain can do, albeit bit faster and better than an average human-being. Today we have seen that the machines can beat human champions in games such as Chess, AlphaGO, which are considered very complex.
 
Machine Learning can be a Supervised or Unsupervised. If you have lesser amount of data and clearly labelled data for training, opt for Supervised Learning.
