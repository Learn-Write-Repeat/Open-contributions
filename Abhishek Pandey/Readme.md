# Opencv Module 2 Summary And About Object Detection 

This module introduce us to various way of image processing and to some new concepts like Object detection.
the module concepts help us to know how to find contours which is very necessary for object detection in real word
I tell this in short

First we have to convert the image into  either in HSV or in grayscale using OpenCV cvtcolor() function
this is necessary for easing the process because before that the image is in BGR format

Second then we have a function in opencv to find countors findcontours() . 
It takes 3 arguments, source image, contour retrieval mode, and contour approximation method in order

it returns the list of countours which can be drawn using drawcontour() function and hence we get the contours 

Now in this module we also learn some image processing technique now lets talk about some of the concepts 


1. Edge Detection
    
   Canny Edge Detection is a popular edge detection algorithm. It was developed by John F. Canny.
   It is a multi-stage algorithm which involves step like 
   
   1.Noise Reduction
   
   2.Finding Intensity Gradient of the Image
   
   3.Non-maximum Suppression
   
   4.Hysteresis Thresholding
   
   But python saves us  from going through these steps OpenCV provides  us cv2.canny() function  which already 
   implement these steps 

2. Grid Detection

    Opencv has a functions to detect the grids for example if we want to detect the grids in chess board then Opencv has function called
    cv2.findChessboardCorners(arguments) which will find the grid with no worry 


###   Now Lets talk About Object Detection 

   What is object detection? Why it is used For  

  Object detection is a computer vision technique that allows us to identify and locate objects in an image or video. With this kind of identification and localization, object     detection can be used to count objects in a scene and determine and track their precise locations, all while accurately labeling them.
  
  ## Algorithm Used 
  
   #### Haar Cascade  
   Haar Cascade classifier is based on the Haar Wavelet technique to analyze pixels in the image into squares by function. This uses “integral image” concepts to compute the       “features” detected. Haar Cascades uses the Ada-boost learning algorithm which selects a small number of important features from a large set to give an efficient result of       classifiers then use cascading techniques to detect the face in an image.
   
   Haar cascade classifier is based on the Viola-Jones detection algorithm which is trained in given some input faces and non-faces and training a classifier that identifies a      face.

   Viola face detection algorithm
   
   1. Haar features: Haar features are similar to convolution kernels which are present Convoultion neural network which is used to detect the features 
   2. AdaBoost algorithm ; AdaBoost is used to remove redundant features and choose only relevant features.
   3. Cascading : It is a process in which all  linear combination of all the output is take and check with the threshold to detemine to take the feature or not
