# Flask
<p><em>Flask is an API of Python that allows us to build up web-applications. It was developed by Armin Ronacher. 
  Flask’s framework is more explicit than Django’s framework and is also easier to learn because it has less base code to implement a simple web-Application. 
  A Web-Application Framework or Web Framework is the collection of modules and libraries that helps the developer to write applications without writing the low-level codes such as protocols, thread management, etc. 
  Flask is based on WSGI(Web Server Gateway Interface) toolkit and Jinja2 template engine.</em></p>
