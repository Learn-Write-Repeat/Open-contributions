# Hey Guys!!

#### I am **Kumari Neha**, brings you this notebook. Where I have discussed very important topic called **Video Analysis**.

#### This notebook will take you through all the important topics from basic to advance. I have tried to cover every topic with an understandable explanation.

### So,let's start the journey..

# VIDEO ANALYSIS USING OPENCV

---

# WE WILL BE COVERING:

---

- Installing OpenCV

- How to load/read video from a live stream and video file

- Displaying video on Screen

- How to save per frame images in the directory

- How to save video in the directory

- How to convert coloured video into - Gray-Scale

- Background Substraction

- Mean shift

- Camshift

- Optical Flow

  - Sparse Optical Flow

  - Dense Optical Flow

## Required Modules:

---

- cv2
- numpy

# Basics of Video Analysis-

---

Here we will cover basic actions like

- Read file
- write file
- save file
- display file
- converting frame from color-scale to gray-scale

# Background Substraction

---

Here we will learn how Background subtraction is done. This technique used for separating out foreground elements from the background and is done by generating a foreground mask.
This technique is used for detecting dynamically moving objects from static cameras

## Applications-

---

- object tracking

# Mean shift

---

Mean shift is a non-parametric feature-space analysis technique for locating the maxima of a density function.

## Application :

---

- cluster analysis in computer vision
- image processing

## Disadvantage:

---

- The selection of a window size is not trivial.
- Inappropriate window size can cause modes to be merged, or generate additional “shallow” modes.
- Often requires using adaptive window size.

# Camshift

---

Continuously adaptive mean-shift(CAMShift) is an efficient and light-weight tracking algorithm developed based on mean-shift. While color based CAMShift is suitable for tracking targets in simple cases.

## Advantage:

---

- object tracking
- Camshift algorithms also used for security, vehicle navigation, surveillance cameras, car driver assistants, biometrics, video games, and industrial automation.

## Disadvantage:

---

- fails to track objects in more complex situations.

# Optical Flow

---

Optical flow or optic flow is the pattern of apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene caused by the relative motion between an observer and a scene.Optical flow can also be defined as the distribution of apparent velocities of movement of brightness pattern in an image.

## TYPES-

---

1. Sparse Optical Flow

1. Dense Optical Flow

## Advantage:

---

Optical flow allows for the estimation of depth information relative to the speed and direction of the linear velocity, and rotational velocity for each of the axes in 3D.
