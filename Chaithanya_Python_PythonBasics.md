# Introduction to Python 

Python is an ***open source programming language*** and it is among the top five most popular languages in the world. It is a good programming language for beginners. Writing programs in Python takes less time than in some other languages like C, C++, Java. Latest version of python is ***python3***.

## Why most of them love python :heart:

Python is not only used for general problem solving but also for the development of high-level applications like -

* **Web Development:** Can perform server side programming through Python libraries like ***Django*** and ***Flask***.

* **Prototyping:** Can create quick prototypes to present the client.

* **Game Development:** Used in the development of games through libraries like ***PyGame***.

* **Data Science and Machine Learning:** It has a great community and a vast range of libraries.

## Why Python ? :thinking:

* :smiley: **Easy to read and learn:** The syntax is very simple and straightforward.

* :ok_hand: **Speedy:** Execution of the code is very fast.

* :zap: **Extensible:** Python can be extended to other languages.

* :heart_eyes: **Free and Open-Source:** It is freely available, can download its source code, make changes to it, and even distribute it.

* :open_mouth: **Interpreted:** Python directly executes the code line by line and not need to be compiled to run.

* :boom: **Protection:** It avoids the harm from software bugs.

## How to install Python in Windows 10 ? 

### 1. Download the Python Installer

* Open the ***[Python Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)*** in your browser.

* In the Downloads tab choose the ***latest version of Python(Python 3.8.5)*** and click on it to download.

* An Executable file will be downloaded.

<hr>

### 2. Run the Executable Installer

* After the completion of download, run the Python Installer.

* Select the check box containing ***the Install launcher for all users***.

* Click on ***Customize Installation***.

* Select the check boxes contaning ***Documentaion, pip, tcl/tk and IDLE, Python test suit, py launcher for all users***.

* Click on ***next*** button.

* This takes you to ***Advanced Options***.

* Here, select the check boxes containg ***Install for all users*** and ***Add Python to environment variables***.

* Click on ***Install*** button to start installation.

* Once the installation is over, you will see a ***Python Setup Successful window***.

<hr>

### 3. Adding Python to environmental variables

* In the start menu, search for ***View advanced system settings*** and open it.

* In the ***System Properties*** window, click on the ***Advanced*** tab and then click on the ***Environment Variables*** button.

* In the ***System Variables*** window, select the ***Path*** variable.

* Click on ***NEW*** and name the variable as ***PATH*** and variable value as the path ***C:\Program Files (x86)\Python38-32;C:\Program Files (x86)\Python38-32\Lib\site-packages;C:\Program Files (x86)\Python38-32\Scripts***.

* Click ***OK***.

<hr>

### 4. Verify the Python Installation

* In the start menu, search for ***Command Prompt*** and open it.

* After opening, to check the installation, type ***python*** or ***python-version*** or ***python -V*** in command prompt.

* You can see the python version you have installed.

* Another alternative is you can search for ***IDLE(Python version)*** in the start menu.

* A python shell will be opened where you can work on python.

## Basic Syntax in Python3

### 1. print() Function

The print function in Python is a function that outputs to your console window whatever you say you want to print out.

For ***Strings*** : print("string or any sentence")\
For ***Numbers*** : print(number)\
For ***Operations with numbers*** : print(number1 operation number2)

**Input:**

</ins>

```md

print("Hello World")
print("welcome to python3")
print(3)
print(5+4)
print(6-2)
print(4/2)
```

**<ins>Output:</ins>**

Hello World\
welcome to python3\
3\
9\
4\
2.0

<hr>

### 2. Value initialization

In python there is no need to declare the datatype(string,integer,....) of the varaiables before initialization.

For ***Strings*** : variable = "string or a sentence"\
For ***Integers*** : variable = number\
For ***Operations with integers*** : variable = number1 operation number2\
variable = variable1 operation variable2

**Input:**

</ins>

```md

a = "What is your name?"
print(a)
b = 7
print(b)
c = 3
print(c)
d = b + c
print(d)
```

**<ins>Output:</ins>**

Here, a = "What is your name?", so by the statement print(a) the output is\
What is your name?\
Here, b = 7, so by the statement print(b) the output is\
7\
Here, c = 3, so by the statement print(c) the output is\
3\
Here, d = b + c , so d = 7 + 3 = 10, so by the statement print(d) the output is\
10

<hr>

### 3. Value Input

In python In python there is no need to declare the datatype(string,integer,....) of the varaiables before taking the input.

For ***Strings*** : variable = input()\
For ***Integers*** : variable = int(input())\
For ***Float*** : variable = float(input())

**Input:**

</ins>

```md

x = input()
print(x)
y = int(input())
print(y)
z = float(input())
print(z)
```

**<ins>Output:</ins>**

Here, by taking input as x = "Hello", so by the statement print(x) the output is\
Hello\
Here, by taking input as y = 8, so by the statement print(y) the output is\
8\
Here, by taking input as z = 10.63, so by the statement print(z) the output is\
10.63

<hr>

### 4. Comments

Comments are used to explain what the code does in each line. Python will ignore the Comments.

***Single line comment*** : We use '#' ( #comment )\
***Multi line comments*** : \
                               #comment1\
                              #comment2\
                              .\
                              .\
                              .\
                   or\
We can use ***Multi line string*** : we represent by \
                                                          """ 
                                                            comment1\
                                                            comment2\
                                                            .\
                                                            .\
                                                            .\ 
                                                          
                                                          """
