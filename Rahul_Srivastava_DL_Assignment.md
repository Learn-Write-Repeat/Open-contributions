# Introduction to Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that is essentially a three-layer neural network.These neural networks aim to imitate the activity of the human brain by allowing it
to "learn" from enormous amounts of data, albeit they fall far short of its capabilities.While a single-layer neural network may produce approximate predictions, additional hidden
layers can help to optimise and improve for accuracy.

Many artificial intelligence (AI) apps and services rely on deep learning to improve automation by executing analytical and physical activities without the need for human 
participation.Everyday products and services (such as digital assistants, voice-enabled TV remotes, and credit card fraud detection) as well as upcoming innovations use deep 
learning technology (such as self-driving cars).


## Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning

The first question arises here, if Deep learning is subset of Machine Learning then how it differs ?
Well answer to this problem , To create predictions, machine learning algorithms use structured, labelled data, which means that certain features are defined from the model's 
input data and grouped into tables.This isn't to say it never uses unstructured data; it just means that if it does, it usually goes through some pre-processing to convert it 
to a structured format.

Deep learning eliminates some of the data pre-processing that machine learning generally entails.These algorithms can ingest and interpret unstructured data such as text and photos,
as well as automate feature extraction, which reduces the need for human specialists. For example, letâ€™s say that we had a set of photos of different pets, and we wanted to categorize
by "cat", "dog", "hamster", et cetera. 

## How Deep Learning works?

Deep learning neural networks, also known as artificial neural networks, use a combination of data inputs, weights, and bias to try to emulate the human brain.These pieces work together 
to recognise, classify, and characterise items in the data accurately.Deep neural networks are made up of numerous layers of interconnected nodes, each of which improves and refines the 
prediction or categorization.This progression of computations through the network is called forward propagation.The visible layers of a deep neural network are the input and output layers. 
The deep learning model ingests the data for processing in the input layer, and the final prediction or classification is performed in the output layer.
