Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence. It focuses on building a model using the data and make predictions on unknown data.
Types of ML:
1.Supervised Learning: Supervised learning works under supervision. The dataset used here will have both features and targets so we teach the model on some part of data 
and after getting experience we then predict on unkown data. It is more like teacher teaching their students.
2.Unsupervised Learning: The dataset do not have any labels so the model has to understand the hidden patterns in the data and have to train data and make predictions 
accordingly.
3.Reinforcement Learning:  there's no dataset during this quite learning, not does one teach the algorithm anything. Here the model is proramed and it learns from 
the environment. If the model do right thing it get rewarded else it learn from its mistakes.

Types of Supervised Learning? :-
1.Regression.
  Types of Regression:
    a.Linear Regression
    b.Logistic Regression
2.Classification.
  Types of Classification:
    a.Decision tree.
    b.Logistic Regression.
    c.Artificial Neural Network.
    d.Random Forest.
    e.Stochastic Gradient Descent.
    f.Naive Bayes.
    g.Support Vector Machine.
    h.K-Nearest Neighbor

Linear Regression: It is one of the easiest algorithm in ML. It shows the relation between 2 variables(input and output). Here the input variable is independent 
variable and output variable is dependent variable it depends on input variable.
It uses the formula Y=B0+B1X, where Y is output and X is input and B0 is intercept on y-axis and B1 is slope of the line. The B0 and B1 values are best selected 
so that the distance between the data points and the line is minimum. Then the line is best fit and makes good predictions.

After making a model we have to check how accurately the model works on differet sets of data. For that there are different metrics to calculate. Using these metrics we
can make our model more accurate and make good predictions.
