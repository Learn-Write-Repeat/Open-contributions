# Covalution Neural Network
  Convolution Neural Network(**CNN**) is mainly used for Computer Vission beccause it is capable of extracting the main feature of image.
  It uses **Filters** to do that and since an image will have huge amount of features to train on, so normal neural network (Straight Forward) will take more time to train and
  the no. of pararmeters to train on will increase exponentially.
  For example a image is of 1080p that means it'll have 1080 * 1080 pixels. Which is equal to 1166400. So this is the no. of
