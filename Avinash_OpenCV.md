I have experience in Python and I work littile bit in OpenCv for face detection and recognition.

In **OpenCV** we can do :
 - Image Processing
 - Object Detection
 - Feature Detection and Description
 - Video Analysis
 - Machine Learning
 
I use OpenCV for Face Detection in following Project
* Face Detection for Online Profile Management System web based using Django:
  - In this Project we collect the user face data through web cam at the time of registration and provide id for that face.
  - And in Admin login we enter all the information related to User.
  - Then in we train the modle for face recognition after this we run the detector to detect the face and show the data accordingly in web portal.
