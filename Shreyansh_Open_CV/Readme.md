# Learning part:

## Live Sketching
1. In the modules till now I learnt about many topics mentioning some of them like making live sketches using camera ( code is mentioned in my uploaded file ) i.e. [Code sketching app](https://github.com/Shreyansh-Gupta/Open-contributions/blob/master/Shreyansh_Open_CV/Sketching%20app.ipynb)

While doing this I learned how to use features of Open-CV (cv2) some of which are:
* Reading images or using camera through Open_CV
* Graying the BGR image
* Blurring, Erosion, Dilation (their meaning, use and applications).
* Finding edges using Canny
* Thresh holding to get optimise results.

As a result, I was able to draw my sketch and also can be used as live sketching using camera. A still pic of results is shown below.

## Gesture Recognition
2. Then came to major part of OpenCV like finding contours in which I made a detector for recognising hand gestures which I've mentioned in my folder as [Extreme contours](https://github.com/Shreyansh-Gupta/Open-contributions/blob/master/Shreyansh_Open_CV/Extreme_countours.ipynb)

While doing this, I learned how to find and detect major ends in the picture which maybe in future can be used in making a gesture controlled apps like digit recognition from gestures from fingers.

One such image which was my output is attached below.

## Feature Detection - Image features
3. Another entry in the field where I took clouds 

![Wallpaper.jpg](https://github.com/Shreyansh-Gupta/Open-contributions/blob/master/Shreyansh_Open_CV/Wallpaper.jpg)

where i tried to find features in the sky and end result came out as 
![Feature in clouds](https://github.com/Shreyansh-Gupta/Open-contributions/blob/master/Shreyansh_Open_CV/Feature%20in%20clouds.png)

During this time, I also learned about many algorithms which are used in Feature Detection like **Harris Corner, SIFT algorithm, Fast algorithm, BREIF, ORB**


## Image Processing
4. Then learned some basics and tried my hands onn again doing things like
* Blending two images upon each other
* Blurring and smoothing
* Edge detection
* Grid Detection

## Face and Eye Detection
5. In this part, I tried to find features from a live video while moving on through my laptop's camera. One base features were Face and eye detection which I've mentioned as [Face n Eye Detection](https://github.com/Shreyansh-Gupta/Open-contributions/blob/master/Shreyansh_Open_CV/Face%20n%20Eye%20detection.ipynb)
 During this time, I also learned about many algorithms which are used in classifications like **Haar Classifier** which I used for classifying.
I was able to detect features like my face and my eyes, a screen shot of succesfully runned output is shown below.

## Application using Flask
6. Here I tried a basic model using flask and runned it on terminal with the code which I've mentioned in [My APP](https://github.com/Shreyansh-Gupta/Open-contributions/tree/master/Shreyansh_Open_CV/App)
 where i used terminal as ![Terminal commands](https://github.com/Shreyansh-Gupta/Open-contributions/blob/master/Shreyansh_Open_CV/App/Running%20flask%20in%20terminal.png)
 
 and output on screen looked like ![Output](https://github.com/Shreyansh-Gupta/Open-contributions/blob/master/Shreyansh_Open_CV/App/Output%20Hello%20Shreyansh.png)
 
*After all this, I deployed a model using ML on Iris on an app using flask which will take some inputs and predict the type of flower between categories.*

***It is a great experience to work while learning and doing tasks with hands-on-projects and real life applications. I'm enjoying the way it is going and looking forward to learn more and making myself skilled to grow in the technical line of work while enjoying it.***
