# Module 2 understanding

<li>In this week we get very dept knowledge of deep learning.</li>
<li>We get a brief introduction to unsupervised and reinforcement learning. From these things, we get know-how unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning works.
In another chapter, we learn about the neural network.</li>
<li>We get started from the biological neuron with its working the copy of that biological neuron which we used in a neural network.</li>
<li>We get the knowledge of neural network structure, types, how to choose the hidden neuron, Keras API, multilayers nets, shallow vs deep neural network,
advantages of multilayers nets, working of neuron, hypothesis, and activation function. </li>
<li>Before the end, we get the touch of convolution layers, full connection, max pooling, and flattering. </li>
