Image Segmentation is the technique of partitioning a computerized image into multiple subdivisions (of pixels) called Image Objects, which would lower the image's complexities and make studying it easier.

It is applicable to many real life problems such as cancer cell detection, and many more where image segmentation plays a pivotal role. 

**Contours:** Basically, it is an outline of some image or object that we just represented to our computer for detection. Contours is a collection of an object in Python, which might be an image, a video frame, or anything else. They are mainly utilized in detection of several types of objects by giving a variable to store the image with its conversion of color using the cv2.cvtcolor() method.

**Shape detection:** Essentially, Shape Detection is the process of locating and detecting various shapes in a picture. By providing computers specific knowledge and processing certain parameters, computers may be taught to recognize shapes in images using OpenCV, and then allow them to behave depending on the judgement. It involves installing and then importing specific libraries. Then after, creation of ShapeDetector class is implemented after which you can process the image and let the computer detect. Lastly, displaying it.

**Image Features:** They are divided into two categories namely-- feature detection and feature description. In feature detection, an image is put into input which leads to the display of pixel co-ordinates of that image as an output. Whereas, feature description distinguishes a feature from other visual features within an image.

Through OpenCV, we can also blend two images into one. Blurring of image can also be done alongwith the reduction of noise from an image through smoothing it. Moreover, different colors can also be mapped utilizing applyColorMap() method. Corner detection, alongwith edge and grid detection can also be carried out with cv2.corberHarris(), cv2.Canny(), and cv2.findCirclesGrid() methods. These all are one of the types, yet we can choose other too according to our needs. 

**Face Detection:** Face detection is a form of computer vision that aids in the recognition and visualisation of human faces in digital images. This technique is the combination of object identification technology that detects examples of semantic objects of a specific class (such as people, structures, and vehicles) in digital photos and videos. Face detection has become increasingly important as technology has advanced. Lastly, we were introduced to make a web application that recognizes face using Flask that just boosted up our basic skills in OpenCV.
