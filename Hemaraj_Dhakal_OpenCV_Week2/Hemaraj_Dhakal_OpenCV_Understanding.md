 # Module 2 Understanding
 
 In this course, I have many things about images like segmentation, counters, and practices using OpenCV.
 I have used mediapipe library to find the objects and their extreme point but in this article, I got to know about its workings.
 I have practiced these things in a colab notebook and which helps me revised the content that I have already done.
 I revised the image processing too in the notebook.  I have practiced the face detection project too.
 I have some knowledge of Django but I havenâ€™t the idea of the flask and these articles and projects help me to get some knowledge about it and I find flask easier to work with.
