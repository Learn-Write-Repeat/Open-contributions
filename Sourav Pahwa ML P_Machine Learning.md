<h1>So far we have learnt about Introduction to Machine Learning, Approching ML problems, Numpy, Pandas, Feature Scaling, Preprocessing and Data Visualization .
Let's Recap!!</h1>

<h1><b>Introduction to Machine Learning</h1></b>

Machine Learning has become a buzzword in the field of technology nowadays. There is race among enterprises to add functionalities in their operations by using machine learning. This has also increased the opportunities for aspiring data scientists. So having knowledge of machine learning is crucial at this moment for every tech enthusiast.

Machine Learning in simple words is teaching computers to learn by themselves without explicitly programming them so that they can perform various repetitive tasks by themselves. Since machines never get tired like humans they can do tasks for longer time. Machines learn when we teach them the pattern of doing any work. They start learning by themselves when they start recoignizing the pattern.

For example, the task of filling water in the tank whenever the tank gets empty. If we teach the machine to detect whether the tank is empty or full and start the motor whenever the tank is empty, it would do this repetitive task on its own. Similarly we can also teach it to stop the motor whenever the tank is full by detecting the water level in the tank.

So the aim of Machine Learning is enabling machines to learn by themselves. Machines need a machine learning model to learn. Data is collected and fed into the machine learning model so that machines can recognize the pattern and do the work on their own.

<p>We gained knowledge about Numpy where we looked at: 
  <li>one-dimensional array</li>
  <li>n-dimensional arrays</li>
  <li>Array Indexing and Slicing</li>
  <li>NumPy Functions</li>
  <li>NumPy Array Reshaping</li>
  <li>NumPy Sorting and Searching</li>
</p>

<p>Then in pandas we looked at the following topics: 
  <li>Pandas Dataframe</li>
  <li>Creating a Pandas DataFrame</li>
  <li>Dealing with Rows and Columns</li>
  <li>Indexing and Selecting Datali>
  <li>Creating a Pandas Series</li>
  <li>Indexing and Selecting Data in Series</li>  
  <li>Functions & Methods</li>
</p>  

<p>
  <li><b>Feature Scaling is a technique to standardize the independent features present in the data in the fixed range. </b></li>
  <li><b>Data Preprocessing is a technique that is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set. It is the most important step to oraganize the data into meaningful manner. Its main aim is to produce clean and efficient code so that it can be easily be understood by machine. It also helps to reduce the time while analyzing the data and also improves to understand the code and increase readability. </b></li>
  <li><b><h3>EDA often the first step in data analysis, implemented before any other techniques.</h3></b></li>
    <li>It is an approach for summarizing, visualizing, and becoming intimately familiar with the important characteristics of a data set.</li>
    <li>It consists techniques that are used to gain some insights on the dataset before doing any modeling.</li>
    <li>EDA is essentially a type of storytelling for statisticians. It allows us to uncover patterns and insights, often with visual methods, within data.</li>  
    <li>EDA is not a set of rules to follow, it is our state of mind.</li>
