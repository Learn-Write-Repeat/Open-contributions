# Open-contributions
This Repository is for sharing knowledge and Learning purpose, and open contributions under DevIncept program.



### Follow these steps to make a contribution:

1. Fork this repository.

2. Select any topic which you want to contribute on from any of: **Python, ML, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP**
    For example: Object detection using OpenCV

3. Create a folder with your name and field you are contributing to, like: **FullName_Field**
    For example, if Ram is contributing to openCV, folder name will be: **Ram_OpenCV** 

4. Add two files for any topic inside that folder:
    1. **Markdown File:** Explaining the "What" and "Why" part.
    2. **Jupyter Notebook:** Explaining the "How" part.

        For example: two files in above example will be:

          1. **YourName_Objectdetection_OpenCV.md:** This file will contain theoritical part about Object detection.
          2. **YourName_Objectdetection_OpenCV.ipynb:** This file will contain implementation part of object detection.


5. After adding these two files, you can create a pull request.


> We believe that "one should learn in a way that he/she can explain it to others" or "Learning by teaching others" is an extremely effective way to learn. You'll have to understand and write what you learned in a Markdown file, not to copy everything (we'll be checking plagiarism before merging it to master) but to explain all important points in the list or tabular format, use images/illustrations over text or whatever you like, in a way that what you write can easily be understood by a person who has no idea about the topic with minimal effort. And for the same topic, if applicable you'll have to write a Jupyter notebook explaining the working of the topics.
