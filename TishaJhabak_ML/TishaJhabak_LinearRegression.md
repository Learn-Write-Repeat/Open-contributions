# Machine Learning

## This repository has been created to contribute some insights on `Machine Learning` as a part of the ML program under *DevIncept*.

we look into differnt learning types in ML, which can futher be broadly classified. The three basic ML problems are:
* Supervised learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning

> ***Supervised Learning***

Supervised Learning is the ML learning problem which comes into light when we deal with data with defined Labels, i.e given a data set, we already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output. In this, our ML model will predict over a target label based on one or more input features.
Supervised learning problems are categorized into **"regression"** and **"classification"** problems based on the type of response or target variable.

> ***Regression***

In a regression problem, we try to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. For example, while trying to predict prize of houses based on size of land, location etc.,stock-prize prediction, etc.
There various regression problems can be linear regression(Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate), Ridge, Lasso, Logistic regession and some others. 
 
> ***Classification***

In a classification problem, we instead try to predict results as discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete set of known categories.
We can deal with Binary classification, Multi-class, Multi-Label and other types of classification problems. For inatance, classifying an image of a cat or dog, predicting where a tumor is malignant or benign, etc.

> ***Unsupervised Lesrning***

Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea of what our results should look like, i.e, we are not povided with lebeled data. We can derive structure from a given data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables. It includes clustering, associstion and generation commonly.For example- taking a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as the lifespan, location, roles etc.
