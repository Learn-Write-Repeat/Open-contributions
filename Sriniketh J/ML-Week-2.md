### Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning works under supervision.the dataset that you have collected here is labelled and so you know what input needs to be mapped to what output. This helps you correct your program if there is some mistake.

### Unsupervised Learning

In unsupervised Learning, info collected here has no labels and you're undecided about the outputs. So you model your program such it can understand patterns from the input file and provides the desired answer(output).

### Underfitting
Underfitting is the case where the model has 'not learned enough' from the training data, resulting in low generalization and unreliable predictions.

### Overfitting
Overfitting is the case where the overall cost is really small, but the generalization of the model is unreliable. This is due to the model learning 'too much' from the training data set.

### Performance measure
Many people feel when their model is build then their job is over. But the main scene starts at this point of time where we need to evaluate our model. There are different evaluation metrics available to measure our models working:
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy
- Recall (Sensitivity)
- Precision
- F1-Score
- Specificity
- Logarithmic Loss
- AUC-ROC Curve
