## OpenCV Topics

* Read and write images
* Building GUI
* Capture and save videos
* Process images (filter, dilation, erosion, transform)
* Canny Edge Detection
* Crop and Resize
* 3D reconstruction
* 3D object recognition and a pose estimation algorithm using 3D features(Surface matching).
* Drawing shapes ang writing text
* Text detection and recognition
* Warp Perspective
* Joining Images
* Perform feature detection(Feature extraction)
* Color Detection
* Detect specific objects such as faces, eyes, cars, in the videos or images(Object detection).
* Optical flow algorithms to track features across successive frames of video(Optical flow algorithms).
* Contour/Shape Detection(Shape analysis)
* Analyze the video(Video analysis)
