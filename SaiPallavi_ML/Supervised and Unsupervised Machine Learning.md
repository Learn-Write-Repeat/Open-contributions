# Machine Learning

The definition of Machine learning goes like : Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. 
Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.

We have been using or witnessing the importance of Machine Learning since we have started using web extensively .
A few daily life examples of machine learning include : 

* YouTube recommendation system 
* Spam mails filtration
* Virtual Personal Assistants (Google Assistant, Apple's Siri, and business based chatbots)
* Traffic predictions (GPS)
* Product recommendation system on online websites and many more


# Types of Machine Learning
* Supervised Machine Learning
* Unsupervised Machine Learning 
* Reinforcement Learning 


Let us have a quick look of what they are and their applications. 

* Supervised Machine Learning :

 In this type of machine learning, data scientists supply algorithms with labeled training data and define the variables they want the algorithm to assess for correlations. 
 Both the input and the output of the algorithm is specified. This is one of the most simplest types as we know the expectations from data we are supplying to the model.
