<h1>**Introduction To ML**</br></h1>
Machine learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence.It is a method of data analysis according to which we create a suitable model to predict something based on analysis and identify patterns and system makes decisions on its own based on previous learning.</br>



<h2>**Types Of Machine Learning**</h2>

<h3>1. Supervised</h3>
Works under supervision.
Maps and output based on the labeled data provided to the model.
Makes prediction based on the relation between dependent and independent variables.

<h3>2. Unsupervised</h3>
Works without any supervision.
Data is not labeled.
Used for clustering.

<h3>3. Reinforcement learning</h3>
In this type of learning system gets rewards and penalties based on prediction.
Tries to achieve maximum rewards.
 
<h3>**Supervised learning**</h3>
 
 
<h4>-->What is Supervised Learning?:-</h4>
Works under supervision.
Maps and output based on the labeled data provided to the model.

<h4>-->Types of Supervised learning</h4>
1. Regression</br>
2. Classification

<h4>-->Application of supervised learning<h4>
  1.Spam filtering</br>
 2.Sentiment Analysis
 
  
  <h4>-->What is regression</h4>
  Regression is a statistical method.
 Which is used to find relationship between one dependent variable (denoted by Y) and  other variables (independent variables).
  
  <h4>-->Types of Regression</h4>
  1.linear regression</br>
  2.Logistic regression
  
  <h4>-->Linear Regression</h4>
  Linear regression is a model that assumes a relationship (Linear) between the input variables (x) and the output variable (y). Output variable y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).</br>
  when there is</br>
  single input variable - simple linear regression</br>
  multiple input variable - multiple linear regression</br>
  
  <h4>-->Representation of linear regression</h4>
  In a simple regression problem  x and  y,</br> 
 the form of the model would be:

                                 *** y = B0 + B1*x ***
  
  </br>
 Suppose we are predicting weight (y) from height (x). </br>
 Our linear regression model representation :

              *** y = B0 + B1 * x1 ***
</br>
or

               *** weight =B0 +B1 * height ***
</br>
