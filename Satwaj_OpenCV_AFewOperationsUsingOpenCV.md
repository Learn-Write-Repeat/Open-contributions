# A Few Basic OpenCV Opeartions

In this document we will try to learn a few basic image processing operations which can be performed with the help Opencv.

**List of Operations included in this doc**

- Histogram Equalization
- Histogram Matching
- Image Steganography

## Histogram Equalization
Histogram Equalization is a process used to enhance the contrast of an image, however the contrast of the image increasing is not always guaranteed. 
It accomplishes this by effectively spreading out the most frequent intensity values, i.e. stretching out the intensity range of the image

## Histogram Matching
Histogram Matching is changing the contrast values of an image with respect to a reference image.

## Drawing a Rectangle
This operation is just drawing a rectangle over an object. For this, we detect the contours of an image and draw a rectangle over it.
