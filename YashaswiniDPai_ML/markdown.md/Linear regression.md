<b>LINEAR REGRESSION</b>

Linear regression is a basic predictive analytics technique that uses historical data to predict an output variable. It is popular for predictive modelling because it is easily understood and can be explained using plain English.
Python has an array of packages for linear regression modelling.

There are two kinds of variables in a linear regression model:
The input or predictor variable is the variable(s) that help predict the value of the output variable. It is commonly referred to as X.
The output variable is the variable that we want to predict. It is commonly referred to as Y.
To estimate Y using linear regression, we assume the equation:
Yₑ = α + β X
where Yₑ is the estimated or predicted value of Y based on our linear equation.
Our goal is to find statistically significant values of the parameters α and β that minimise the difference between Y and Yₑ.If this satifies then line of best fit can be determined.
 
It can also handle multi dimensional linear models.
y = a0 + a1 x1 + a2 x2+...where there are multiple x values

Applications:
1.Stock price Prediction
