## **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**

### What is this Game all about?

Tic Tac Toe is one of the most played games and is the best time killer game that you can play anywhere with just a pen and paper. If you don’t know how to play this game don’t worry let us first understand that.

## Rules!

The game is played by two individuals. First, we draw a board with a 3×3 square grid. The first player chooses ‘X’ and draws it on any of the square grid, then it’s the chance of the second player to draw ‘O’ on the available spaces. Like this, the players draw ‘X’ and ‘O’ alternatively on the empty spaces until a player succeeds in drawing 3 consecutive marks either in the horizontal, vertical or diagonal way. Then the player wins the game otherwise the game draws when all spots are filled.


###Steps for creating the project

1.Create the display window for our game.
2.Draw the grid on the canvas where we will play Tic Tac Toe.
3.Draw the status bar below the canvas to show which player’s turn is it and who wins the game.
4.When someone wins the game or the game is a draw then we reset the game.
