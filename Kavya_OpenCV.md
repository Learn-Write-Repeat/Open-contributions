I have beginner level knowledge in *Python* but a fresher when it comes to *OpenCV*

*Python:*

- Datatypes

  1. Strings
  
  2. Tuples
  
  3. Lists 
  
  4. Dictionaries
  
  5. Numbers 
  
      - Integers
      
      - Float
      
      - Decimal
      
      - Boolean
      
- Python Operators
- Flow Control
- Loops
- Regular Expressions
- Functions

*OpenCV:*
- No prior knowledge, a complete fresher.
- OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems.
- OpenCV is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object detection.
- Since OpenCV is one among the important fields in Python, I'd like to involve myself in learning it.
