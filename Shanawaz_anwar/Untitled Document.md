### Deep Learning module-2 summary
By Shanawaz Anwar

## Reinforcement Learning
It  is an area of machine learning .It is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation.it learns from experience i.e. trail and error.

## Dimensionality Reduction

The process or method to reduce or compress a dimensionality of a dataset without losing important information is called as dimensionality reduction .it is important in mitigating 'Curse of Dimensionality'.

## Neural Network Layers

There are different types of layers in neural nets, they perform different transformations on their inputs . and some layers are better suited for some tasks than others. 
Some of the layers are:
1. Dense(fully connected ) layers
2. Convolutional layers
3. pooling layers
4. Recurrent layers
5. Normalization layers
