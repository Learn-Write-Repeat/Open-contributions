    "From this module i basically got the defintion of machine learning,and what does machine learning and how does machine learning helps to solve real world problems.Here from this module I understood the types of machine learning.I understood the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.I also understood in which scenario which technique is used to solve problem, such as if my outputshould be a prediction i use supervised learning algorithms,if it is a classification kind of problem i use unsupervised machine learning algorithms.I also learnt when to use which algorithm based on the data available. I learnt various statistical concepts like scaling,normalization,precision,recall etc.... Specially in this module I completely understood about regression problem and various algorithms to solve regression prolems like linear regression and polynomial regression.\n"
