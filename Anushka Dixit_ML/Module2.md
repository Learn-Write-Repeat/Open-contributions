# Module 2 - Machine Learning 
Machine Learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.
There are three major types of Machine Learning: 
  - Supervised Learning 
  - Unsupervised Learnng 
  - Reinforcement Learning 

## 1. Supervised Learning 
   - Works under supervision
   - Uses labelled dataset for training: both input and output available
   - Dataset is split into two parts: Training and Testing 
   - Training data is used to train the ML model
   - Testing data checks the accuracy of the ML model
  
  ### Types of Supervised Learning 
  1. Regression
  2. Classification

 ### Regression
  Types of Regression include:
  1. Logistic Regression
  2. Linear Regression
  
  ### Classification
  Types of classification algoriths:
  1. Decision tree.
  2. Logistic Regression.
  3. Artificial Neural Network.
  4. Random Forest.
  5. Stochastic Gradient Descent.
  6. Naive Bayes.
  7. Support Vector Machine.
  8. K-Nearest Neighbor.
    

## 2. Unsupervised Learning
  - Models are trained using unlabeled dataset and are allowed to act on that data without any supervision
  - It is hoped that through mimicry, the machine is forced to build a compact internal representation of its world and then generate imaginative content
  - Can recongnize patterns in unlabelled data, help in categorization
  - Help in finiding anomalies
  - Can work on unlabelled data

 ### Types of Supervised Learning 
  1. Clustering
  2. Association

## 3. Reinforced Learning 
- Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.
- Differs from the supervised learning in a way that in supervised learning the training data has the answer key with it so the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the given task. In the absence of a training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience.
- Input: The input should be an initial state from which the model will start
- Output: There are many possible output as there are variety of solution to a particular problem
- Training: The training is based upon the input, The model will return a state and the user will decide to reward or punish the model based on its output.
- The model keeps continues to learn.
- The best solution is decided based on the maximum reward.
