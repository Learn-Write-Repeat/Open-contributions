# Hi folks

## I am Gurdeep Singh Bhatia :smile:

#### *First of all glad to be the part of this contribution.*

OpenCV is a library which is used for computer vision task and i have gud knowledge related to this library along with brilliant knowledge of computer vision using deep learning 

Through opencv we can do various task :

1. Image transformation 
  * Affine transformation
  * Non-Affine transformation

2. Dilation, Erosion, like processes

3. Sharpening, Blurring :- there are varoius functions through which we can do blurring :
    * Gaussian Blurring
    * Median Blurring
    * Bilateral Blurring

4. Edge detection in which canny function is one of the most famous 

5. Segmentation, Contours-Extraction 

6. Object detection 

7. Face recognition 

8. Image preprocessing which is very important in computer vision projects as we have to extract features. One of the most famous technique is blending which we can use by **addWeighted** function of opencv
