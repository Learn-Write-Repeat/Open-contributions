# About this module
In this module I have learned the following thing :
- Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. 
- The types of machine learning algorithms are mainly divided into three categories:

      ![Types of machine learning](/mltypes.png)
  - Supervised Learning :- Supervised Learning works under supervision.the dataset that you have collected here is labelled and so you know what input needs to be mapped to what output. This helps you correct your program if there is some mistake.

  - Unsupervised Learning :- the info collected here has no labels and you're undecided about the outputs. So you model your program such it can understand patterns from the input file and provides the desired answer(output).

  - Reinforcement Learning :- there's no dataset during this quite learning, not does one teach the algorithm anything. You model the program ,it interacts with the environment and if the algorithm does an honest job, you reward it.It's kind of like our life like parents make a deal(if you get good marks i'll buy you new i-phone).
