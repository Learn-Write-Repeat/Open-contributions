## Data Structures

### Data Structure is a core concept of computer science by which we can do programming in any other progrmming languages. Data structure are used to store the data elements in a sequential manner.

#### In Python we can call Data Structure as Collections. Collections are containers that are used to store collections of data.
#### There are 4 Built-in collections or data structure namely:-
- List
- Dictionary
- Tuple
- Set

## What is a List?

A List is used to store the sequence of various types of data. Data are inclosed inside [ ] brackets seprated by commas(,). Lists are mutable in nature it means data which can be changed when required. Duplicate entries are allowed in list.  A list can also have another list as an item. This is called a nested list.

###### Syntax:-
    list1 = [ ] #Empty List
    list2 = [ sequence1 ]
    list3 = [ sequence1, sequence2, sequence3 ]
    
###### Example:-
    language = ['C','C++','Java','Python']       //List of Strings
    number = [3,5,4,9]                           //List of Numbers
    mixed = ['Mango','Apple',1,'Banana',8]       //List of Mixed Data Type 
    nested = [['Raman', 'Nikhil'],[2,5,7]]       //List of Nested List
    deep_nested = ['Honey','Deepak',[1,5,8,['Akshay','Shubham',['India','Australia]]]]              //Deeply Nested
    
- Each element in the list has a position in the list known as an index. The list index starts from zero.

| Element |Index|
|-------- |-----|
|  23461  |  0  |
|  77194  |  1  |
|  10295  |  2  |
|  14920  |  3  |

- Index positions actually help us to directly access a value from the list. list_name[index] can be used to directly access the list element at the mentioned index position.
- If we want to access an element directly, we can also use it to directly modify an element in the list.  element[1] = 23413

## Basic Operations of List

|  Python Expression  |    Result    |  Operation  |
|---------------------|--------------|-------------|
|   [1,2,3]+[8,9,9]   |[1,2,3,8,9,9] | Concatination|
|   len([4,5,6])      | 3            | Length |  
|   7 in [1,4,7]      | True         |Membership|
| for n in [1,3,5]: print (n) | 1 3 5 |Iteration|
|n=[1,3,7] print(n[2]) |7|Indexing: Offset Starts at 0|  
|n=[1,3,7] print(n[-2])|3|Negative Slicing: Count from right|
|n=[1,3,7] print(n[1:])|[3,7]|Slicing|

## Built-in methods and functions in lists

|   Function   |                Description                      |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|cmp(list1,list2)| Compare elements of both list|
|len(list)|Give total Length of list|
|max(list)|Return item from list with maximum value|
|min(list)|Return item form list with minimum value|
|list(seq)|converts a tuple to list|
|list.append(obj)|Append object obj to list|
|list.count(obj)|Return count of how many times obj occurs in list|
|list.insert(index,obj)|Insert object obj to list at offset index|
|obj=list.pop()|Remove the item at position -1 from list  and assigns it to obj|
|list.remove(obj)|Removes object obj from list|
|list.reverse()|Reverses  the order of items in list|
|sorted(list)|Sorts item in list|
