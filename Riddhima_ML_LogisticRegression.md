#       LOGISTIC REGRESSION



## What is Logistic Regression?


Logistic Regression is a Predictive Analysis. It is used to define relationship between an independent variable and a binary dependent variable. It is mostly used method for binary classification problems. It is used to estimate the probability of occurrence of an event, given some data which has only two possibilities, either the event happens(1) or the event doesn't happen(0). Such a variable is known as "dichotomous" or "binary" variable. The main drawback of logistic regression is its assumption of linearity between dependent and independent variable. Generally, we don't get such data in which we can divide the dependent variable into just two categories. Usually, the data we get are a lot messier. Logistic regression uses some logistic functions to derive the value.





## Why do we use Logistic Regression?


We use Logistic Regression only when the output we want is to be divided into two categories only. As compared to linear regression, logistic regression is quick and easy to implement and very efficient to train. Also, logistic regression is less likely to overfitting, given the data set is not high dimensional. We should use logistic regression only when the dependent variable takes only two values, but there is no any restriction for independent values.
