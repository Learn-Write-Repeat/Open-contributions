## Scikit Learn
### What is Scikit Learn and Why?

Scikit Learn is one of the most advanced and powerful library of Machine Learning using Python.
Scikit Learn gives us a practical access to a lot of Machine Learning Algorithms as :

 * Supervised Learning  - Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree etc., 
 * Unsupervised Learning - clustering, factor analysis, PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
 * Dimensionality Reduction
 * Ensemble Methods
 
 Now coming to part that HOW Scikit-Learn is used in Natural Language Processing.
 
 Text is one of the most important and essential part of NLP. Hence classification of this text in a very fexible 
 and understandable way becomes very necessary. Therefore Text Classification is a very important task in NLP.
 Text classification has a variety of applications, such as detecting user sentiment from a tweet, classifying an email as spam or ham, 
 classifying blog posts into different categories, automatic tagging of customer queries, and so on.
 
 But some of the basic operations of NLP which are performed using Scikit Learn are : 
 
 1. Importing Datasets
    
    We can import datasets in many ways but the advantage of importing it with Scikit Learn is we can use load_files function from sklearn_datasets
    and it directly divides the dataset into data and target sets.
    
 2. Text Preprocessing
   
   Text may contain numbers, special characters, and unwanted spaces. Depending upon the problem we face, we may or may not need to remove \
   these special characters and numbers from text. And this is what preprocessing is removing symbols special characters etc.
 
 3. Tokenization and Bag of Words
 
   Tokenization is the process of breaking a document down into words, punctuation marks, numeric digits, etc.
   
 4. Tf-idf Vectorizer
 
   TF-IDF is an abbreviation for Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency. This is very common algorithm to transform text into a meaningful 
   representation of numbers which is used to fit machine algorithm for prediction.
   
 5. Sentiment Analysis
 
 It is Simply classification or analysis of emotions using language processing and text processing techniques
 e.g. Tweet sentiment analysis
