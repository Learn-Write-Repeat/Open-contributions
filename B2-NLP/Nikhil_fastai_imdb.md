First let's download the dataset we are going to study. The [dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) has been curated by Andrew Maas et al. and contains a total of 100,000 reviews on IMDB.
 25,000 of them are labelled as positive and negative for training, another 25,000 are labelled for testing (in both cases they are highly polarized). The remaning 50,000 is an additional unlabelled data (but we will find a use for it nonetheless).

We'll begin with a sample we've prepared for you, so that things run quickly before going over the full dataset.
