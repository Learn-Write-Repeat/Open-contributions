# Introduction to Use-Experience(UX) Design

The field of User Experience spans across a breadth of focuses, often leading to confusion about what exactly it covers. In essence, User Experience is a human-centered approach to solving problems, but the lens and definition may change depending on which aspect you're looking at.


## The Definition of User Experience

The literal meaning of the phrase **User Experience** is very simple and can be easily derived from the word itslelf. It is basically - **what the user experiences**. 
As simple as it may seem by the looks of it, there's actually a huge process going on in the background of these two words which involves art, style, character, persona, thought process, psychology, mathematics and much much more.

We can take a very basic example of turning on a switch of a light. For turning the light on, we have to interact with the component which can deceive us as a very elementary task, the component i.e. the switch has its particular shape, size, color, material, physical appearance, functionality -- which all may impact how we feel about the interaction.

Likewise, in the scene of digital world, *UX refers to everything that affect's a user's interaction with a digital product*. When people avail a product, there are some **criterion** or points with respect to which they evaluate it:

 - **Value** - Does this product give me Value?
 - **Functionality** - How does this product work?
 - **Usability** - Is it easy to use?
 - **General Impression** - How does the user feel while using it?
So, in layman's terms we can say that  user experience is about what user thinks and feels rationally and emotionally while interacting with a component or product.
