# MACHINE LEARNING
Machine learning is a form of AI that enables a system to learn from data rather than through explicit programming.However,machine learning is not a simple process.
Machine learning uses a variety of algorithms that iteratively learn from data to improve, describe data, and predict outcomes. 
As the algorithms ingest training data, it is then possible to produce more precise models based on that data. A machine learning model is the output generated when you train your machine 
learning algorithm with data.After training, when you provide a model with an input, you will be given an output. 
# WHY MACHINE LEARNING?
1. Reduce Time Programming
2. Customize and Scale Products
3. Completely seeemingly "unprogrammable" tasks
4. Changes the way you think about problem
