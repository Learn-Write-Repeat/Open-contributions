I have a basic knowledge of **Linear Regression, Classification, Clustring**.
I have an intermidiate knowledge about **Deep Learning** and I am still learning it.
I don't have in-depth knowledge of all these topics but will get to know and learn much about it by getting appropriate guidance and mentoring.
I want to do good Projects based on Machine Learning and Deep Learning and want to Contribute.
